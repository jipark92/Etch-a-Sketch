In this browser version of Etch-a-Sketch project. I will be displaying my DOM manipulation skill by using javascript and css to style the project.  I will be only using DOM MANIPULATION to add htmls contents through javascript. Nothing will be edited inside of the HTML file.

At the end of this project, I will have better understanding of creating HTML content using Javascript by using DOM MANIPULATION. Also I will learn to create grids which is something very complicated at the moment but I hope to have better understanding of it as I work through this project.


tools used to learn how to create the project:

    -google

    -youtube

    -stackoverflow

    -from previous odin lessons.

    -odin discord community 




Update: 3/6/2022.
I have came back to this project to fix bugs and make extra features work. I have leanred alot since and coming back to fixing this project was another test to see if I know my javascript skill.
