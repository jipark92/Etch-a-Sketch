# Etch-a-Sketch
In this browser version of Etch-a-Sketch project. I will be displaying my DOM manipulation skill by using javascript and css to style the project.  I will be only using DOM MANIPULATION to add htmls contents through javascript. Nothing will be edited inside of the HTML file.

At the end of this project, I will have better understanding of creating HTML content using Javascript by using DOM MANIPULATION. Also I will learn to create grids which is something very complicated at the moment but I hope to have better understanding of it as I work through this project.


tools used to learn how to create the project:

-google
-youtube
-stackoverflow
-from previous odin lessons.
-odin discord community
